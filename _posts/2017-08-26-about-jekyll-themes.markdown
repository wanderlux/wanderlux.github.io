These are some of the ideas I find while I build my own Jekyll theme.

# Moon

Contains animations and some nice includes like:

* buttons styled like keyboard caps
* projects page
* disqus
* nice syntax highlighting
* minimal
* moon themed (+ extra points)
* light text weight
* steam as a social network

# NexT

**Very minimal**, black and white theme.

* underline animation for links
* nice syntax highlighting
* emojis (I know, I am sorry!)
* side table of contents on post
* light text weight

# Halve

* parted screen with an image/text layout (feels like a magazine!)
* minimal but effective style for links

# Tale
[by chesterhow](https://chesterhow.github.io/tale/)

* Link animations
* post preview

# Casper
[default Ghost theme](http://demo.ghost.io/)

* best typography so far
* highlight text
* footnotes
* full bleed images
* bold big images
* cover images for posts
* yeah, basically anything to do with images

# Start Bootstrap
[by volny](https://volny.github.io/creative-theme-jekyll/)

* colorful images overlay
* uses Bootstrap and FontAwesome

# My *dream* Jekyll theme

These are the **features I like the most** and I will try to put in my own theme. They are in no particular order.

* full bleed images
* side table of contents on post
* nice syntax highlighting
* buttons styled like keyboard caps
* projects page
* light text weight
* footnotes
* highlight text
* steam social link

I would like to style it on the **minimal** side around one of this two themes:

* universe/moon
* black and white + one accent colour
