## Hello.

![This is dog](https://media.giphy.com/media/pSpmpxFxFwDpC/giphy.gif)

I am a Computer Science engineer that is working as a web and GIS developer. I am interested in web components, mobile applications and everything else.

I am learning to build a Jekyll site using GitHub pages after some time trying to host a ghost website.

## Motivation

![But why](https://media.giphy.com/media/1M9fmo1WAFVK0/giphy.gif)

I became a big fan of **Latex** and **Sphinx** for writing papers and documentation. I spread the word on the wonders of Latex in every chance I have. Eventually I found about [Ghost](http://ghost.org "Ghost") and discovered **Markdown** (or *the Latex for websites* as I name it in my brain).

I was thinking for a long time now on finding a way of documenting the knowledge on random technologies I end up learning for whatever reasons. Having a simple website like this meets all my requirements on this matter.

## Resources

These are the useful links that I am using in the process (besides the official Jekyll ones):

* [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ "Jonathan McGlone")
* [Markdown cheatsheet](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf "Markdown cheatsheet")
* [Make a Static Website with Jekyll](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/ "Tania Rascia")

## Now What

Mostly, there are a lot of things I do not like about Jekyll's default theme. It is simple and clean. But too simple. Probably one of the first things I will learn about Jekyll is theming.

# My perfect Jekyll theme has

* A different date format (dd mm yyyy)
* Default centered images
* Secondary class for full width images
* Third class for not that big images when it comes to GIF images
* Emphasized subtitle under the images
* Accent colour
* Justified text ?
* Heading sizes that I am able to understand

## First problems I found while writing this short post

# 1. I do not understand headings

Why `# Now What` renders a 24px font and `## My perfect Jekyll theme has` renders a 26px font. I understood it should be the other way around.

# 2. I am not good at writing

Well I already knew this one.

# 3. Looks like I have to manually post fill time and categories

Does not look it will be cool if I want to update a good bunch of posts or change the name of a category.
