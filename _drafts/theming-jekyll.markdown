These are some of the ideas I find while I customize my own Jekyll theme.

This theme contains amazing animations and some nice includes like:

* buttons styled like keyboard caps
* projects page
* disqus
* nice syntax highlighting
* minimal
* perfect favicon
* moon themed (+ extra points)
* light text weight

**Very minimal**, black and white theme.

* underline animation for links
* nice syntax highlighting
* emojis (I know, I am sorry!)
* side table of contents on post
* light text weight

# Halve

* parted screen with an image/text layout (feels like a magazine!)
* minimal but effective style for links

# Tale

* Link animations
* post preview
# What did I pick to be in my own theme

These are the common features I like the most and I will try to put in my own theme. They are in no particular order.

* automated includes for images
* side table of contents on post
* nice syntax highlighting
* buttons styled like keyboard caps
* projects page
* minimal
* light text weight
* galaxy/moon themed
